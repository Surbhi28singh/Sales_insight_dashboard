# 📊 Power BI Sales Dashboard Project

## 👩‍💻 Created by: Surbhi Singh

This project was built during my Power BI learning journey, inspired by the [Power BI Full Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/bQ-HTp-tx40). It simulates a real-world scenario where business sales data is analyzed and visualized through interactive dashboards.

The final report provides a 360° overview of business performance across time, geography, and products — helping users uncover actionable insights at a glance.
